Step 8: introducing JSX and Babel

Note: we have to introduce a web server now, because of ``script src="â€¦" type="text/babel"`` making an XHR request

## Compatibility

Babel ensures full ES6 compatibility with all browsers

## Installation

Nothing to do

## Development

* Launch ``static/index.html`` in your browser
* Look how this does not work because of cross-origin on ``file://``
* Edit JS/CSS
* Refresh

## Production

Do not deploy yet, it's broken.
